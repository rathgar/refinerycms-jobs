This version of `refinerycms-jobs` supports Refinery 3.x and Rails 4.1.x.  To use Rails 3.x / Refinery 2.0.x use the [refinerycms-jobs "Refinery CMS 2-0 stable branch"](http://github.com/refinery/refinerycms-jobs/tree/2-0-stable).

## Requirements

[Refinery CMS](http://refinerycms.com) version 3.0.0 or above.

## Install

Open up your ``Gemfile`` and add at the bottom this line:

```ruby
gem 'refinerycms-jobs', git: 'https://github.com/bisscomm/refinerycms-jobs', branch: 'master'
```

Now, run ``bundle install``

Next, to install the jobs plugin run:

    rails generate refinery:jobs

Run database migrations:

    rake db:migrate

Finally seed your database and you're done.

## Developing & Contributing

The version of Refinery to develop this engine against is defined in the gemspec. To override the version of refinery to develop against, edit the project Gemfile to point to a local path containing a clone of refinerycms.
